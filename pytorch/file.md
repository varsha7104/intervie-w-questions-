## 1) What is Pytorch ?

A)a)  Pytorch is an open source deep learning frame work built to be flexible and modular for research, with the stability and support needed for production deployement.
 
 b) Pytorch is python library that helps to train  the neural networks easily

c) Pytorch is  a product for Facebook AI research lab  is an open source machine learning library  built strength  of dynamic  computation graphs .It features  and workflow
have a popular choice for researchers and developer like.
Computational Graph :It is used to visualize and organize the mathematical  operations  as a graph  of nodes and edges 
##  Key Features :
###  a)  Dynamic  Computation : TensorFlow primarily utilizes static computational graphs whereas Pytorch utilizes the dynamic computational graph .It facitilates with dynamic computational capabilities
