# TensorFlow
## tensorflow definition 
A) Open source library developed by Google for numerical computation and machine learning
b) efficiently handle large scale machine learning and deep learning tasks
c) used to build and deploy ml models

## tensorflow features
a) scalability:can start in one server and later use on other server without major code changes

b) portable : can run on various cpu and gpu 

c) tensor board : tensor board is powerful visualization tool for the visualizing 

d) flexibility: ml and dl models such as rnn ,cnn etc

## explain  the concept of  tensors ?
tensors are fundamental data structures that represent and manipulate data 
term "tensors" refers to the mathematical concept that generalize the vector and matrices to higher dimensional data
it can store n dimensional data of single datatype 
##  difference between  tensor flow and pytorch ?
tensorflow is developed by google in 2015 whereas pytorch was developed by facebook meta ai in 2016 tensorflow uses more static graphs for computation whereas pytorch uses dynamic computational graph tensorflow is more used in production than pytorch Tensoflow learning tfx ,and torch serve onnx are production ready tools for tensor flow and pytorch respectively
